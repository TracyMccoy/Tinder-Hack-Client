#Readme

This is the client for my [tinder hack](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/swipr-auto-liker-for-tinder/id919218867?mt=8). Its has not been re-written or rather made suitable to fit as it is into your project.

Things you can do with this client. (in no particular order)

1. Authenticate/Login user to tinder.
2. Fetch users recommendations.
3. Update your profile.
4. Like profile (swipe right)
5. Pass user (Swipe left)
6. Parse User (this shouldnt be here really)


This is the same client in use for my app. [Swipr](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/swipr-auto-liker-for-tinder/id919218867?mt=8)
